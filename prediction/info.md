# Overview of Oceanographic Variables

    This table provides a comprehensive overview of various oceanographic variables, detailing their specific names, acronyms, the units of measurement used, the sources from which they were downloaded, the time periods they cover, and the depths at which they were measured. The variables include physical parameters such as temperature and salinity, as well as chemical constituents like dissolved oxygen and nutrients. Understanding these variables is crucial for analyzing ocean dynamics and biogeochemical processes.
